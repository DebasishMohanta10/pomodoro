# Pomodoro App

Pomodoro is a customizable timer that helps you to concentrate on any task you are working on like writing, studying or coding to boost your productivity. This app is inspired by Pomodoro Technique which is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo.​

The Pomodoro technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.​
